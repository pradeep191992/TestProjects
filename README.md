# UI-UX-Recruitment

Hi! Please read through the instructions carefully. The total duration of the test is *4 hours*. 

This repo contains 2 directories, each directory contains a small test. Both tests are supposed to be attempted in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

Once completed, upload the project to your own account and provide a link to a single repo which includes files for all the tests or share the code over email in a zip file. Be creative where required. Feel free to use any design library of your own choice.

Each test directory should contain a README.md which has detailed steps on how to run the project and (if any) what environment variables need replacement.

In case of any queries or concerns, please reach out to us at tech-dl@neotas.com. Best of luck!

_- Team Neotas_
